#### Timezones

When creating a new Time Off/Downtime event, a timezone may be specified if the Time Off/Downtime event is being created for multiple resources. If left blank, it will default to the local timezone of each resource.
The timezone values are based off of Ruby On Rails's ActiveSupport::TimeZone's key mappings. For example, to create a Time Off/Downtime event for (GMT +0) London, the value would be "London". See our [timezone](../timezones.md) page for a list of valid timezones.
